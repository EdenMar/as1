Assignment1

This is my submission for the assignment 1 Counter app. From a design standpoint, I tried to utilize MainActivity as a starting menu, where my New and Load buttons would trigger my CounterMenu activity; depending on which was pressed, I could pass data to CounterMenu to construct a brand new Counter, or construct a Counter with preset data. I was able to do the first, but not the second. Further, I wasn't able to implement a statistics tracking mechanism. --Eden Mar
