Assignment1

This is my submission for the assignment 1 Counter app. From a design standpoint, I tried to utilize MainActivity as a starting menu, where my New and Load buttons would trigger my CounterMenu activity; depending on which was pressed, I could pass data to CounterMenu to construct a brand new Counter, or construct a Counter with preset data. I was able to do the first, but not the second. Further, I wasn't able to implement a statistics tracking mechanism, and the best I could come up with was a scrollbar. I also wanted to implement a method to have the titleText show the name of the counter by changing the android.hint associated with it, but I wasn't able to figure that one out either. --Eden Mar
